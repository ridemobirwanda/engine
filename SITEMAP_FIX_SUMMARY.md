# 🔧 Sitemap.xml Issue - FIXED!

## 🚨 Problem Identified

Your sitemap.xml was being blocked by Google Search Console with the error:
```
Page cannot be crawled: Blocked by robots.txt
```

## ✅ Root Cause Found

The issue was in your `robots.txt` file on **line 59**:
```
Disallow: /*.xml$
```

This rule was blocking ALL XML files, including your sitemap.xml!

## 🔧 Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed robots.txt** ✅
**Before:**
```
# Disallow private files
Disallow: /*.json$
Disallow: /*.xml$    ← This was blocking sitemap.xml!
Disallow: /supabase/
```

**After:**
```
# Disallow private files
Disallow: /*.json$
Disallow: /supabase/
Disallow: /migrations/
Disallow: /scripts/

# Allow sitemap.xml specifically
Allow: /sitemap.xml
```

### 2. **Updated sitemap.xml** ✅
- ✅ Updated all dates from `2024-01-20` to `2025-10-02` (current date)
