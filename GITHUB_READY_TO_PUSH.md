## 📝 Example

### Your GitHub Info:
```
Username: john_doe
Repository: enginemarket
URL: https://github.com/john_doe/enginemarket.git
Token: ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### When Running Script:
```
Enter your GitHub repository URL: https://github.com/john_doe/enginemarket.git
[Enter pressed]
[Script asks for password]
[Paste your token]
[Enter pressed]
✅ Done!

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "dist folder not found"
```bash
npm run build
```
Then run the script again.

### "Authentication failed"
- Make sure you're using Personal Access Token (not password)
- Token must have `repo` permission
- Token must not be expired

### "fatal: remote origin already exists"
- The script will handle this automatically
- Just run it again
