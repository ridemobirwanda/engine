# Fixed Scripts Summary

## üêõ Issues Fixed

### 1. Infinite Loop in react-override.js
**Problem**: The script was running `setInterval(overrideReactInternals, 1000)` which caused infinite loops and blocked the website.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the `setInterval` 
- Added retry limits (`maxRetries = 10`)
- Added `overrideApplied` flag to prevent multiple executions
- Simplified the override logic

### 2. Infinite Loop in cloudflare-bypass.js
**Problem**: The script was running `setInterval(bypassCloudflare, 2000)` which caused infinite loops and blocked the website.

**Solution**:
- Removed the `setInterval`
- Added retry limits (`maxRetries = 5`)
- Added `bypassApplied` flag to prevent multiple executions
- Simplified the bypass logic

### 3. Complex Google Ads Loading
**Problem**: The `CloudflareGoogleAdsFixed` component was trying 5 different methods simultaneously, causing conflicts and loading issues.

**Solution**:
- Simplified to use only one reliable method
- Removed complex fallback methods that were causing conflicts
- Added proper cleanup with `clearTimeout`
- Reduced complexity to prevent loading issues

### 4. Overly Complex React Polyfill
**Problem**: The React polyfill was trying to override too many methods, causing conflicts.

**Solution**:
- Simplified to only essential polyfills
- Removed complex method overrides
- Kept only the necessary polyfills for `useLayoutEffect`, `useEffect`, `useState`, and `createElement`

## ‚úÖ What's Working Now

1. **No Infinite Loops**: All scripts run once and stop
2. **No Spinner Issues**: Website loads normally without getting stuck
3. **Google Ads Loading**: Simple and reliable Google Ads loading
4. **React Compatibility**: Fixed useLayoutEffect issues without conflicts
5. **Cloudflare Bypass**: Simple bypass that doesn't interfere with page loading

## üîß Files Modified

1. `public/react-override.js` - Simplified, no infinite loops
2. `public/cloudflare-bypass.js` - Simplified, no infinite loops  
3. `public/react-polyfill.js` - Simplified, essential polyfills only
4. `src/components/CloudflareGoogleAdsFixed.tsx` - Simplified loading method

## üöÄ How to Deploy
